Installation

For simplicity during the path setting, Apache server need to be installed. Our team used XAMPP so we're providing a guide for XAMPP only.

1. Install a distribution of XAMPP based on your platform (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

2. Clone or download this repository, assuming that the root folder is asr/
	- For MacOS, put the folder asr/ in /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/
	- For Windows, put the folder asr/ in C:/xampp/htdocs/ (or the installed path)

3. Run server based on your platform
	- For MacOS, run manager-osx (type the word in the Spotlight). Then go to "Manage Servers" tab, choose Apache Web Server and choose Start.
	- For Windows, "XAMPP Control Panel" should already be installed with XAMPP. The shortcut should be on your desktop. Open it and Press Start on the row that has Apache as a Module. 

4. Open the application website via the url localhost:80/asr

For any issue, please contact us.
